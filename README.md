# ALX Backend User Data Repository

## Overview

This repository contains my projects from the **ALX Software Engineering Program**, focusing on backend user data management and authentication systems. These projects have helped me gain practical experience in implementing secure, scalable user authentication and managing personal user data in web applications. Iâ€™ve learned how to build systems that prioritize security and user data privacy.

The repository covers key user data management concepts, including:

  * **Personal Data Management** â€“ Storing and managing user-specific data securely.
  
  * **Basic Authentication** â€“ Implementing simple authentication systems with username and password.

  * **Session Authentication** â€“ Managing user sessions to persist authenticated states across requests.

  * **User Authentication Service** â€“ Building a complete authentication service for user registration, login, and access control.
