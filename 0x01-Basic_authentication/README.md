# 0x01. Basic authentication
## The Domains/Concepts covered in this project: `Back-end` `Authentification`

This project introduced me to basic authentication, a foundational method for securing backend systems by verifying user credentials. I learned how to implement HTTP basic authentication, manage secure storage of credentials, and ensure proper handling of authentication headers in backend applications.

## Background Context

In this project, you will learn what the authentication process means and implement a **Basic Authentication** on a simple API.

In the industry, you should **not** implement your own Basic authentication system and use a module or framework that doing it for you (like in Python-Flask: [Flask-HTTPAuth](https://flask-httpauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)). Here, for the learning purpose, we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.

Download and start your project from this archive.zip

In this archive, you will find a simple API with one model: User. Storage of these users is done via a serialization/deserialization in files.

Setup and start server

```
bob@dylan:~$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
...
bob@dylan:~$
bob@dylan:~$ API_HOST=0.0.0.0 API_PORT=5000 python3 -m api.v1.app

**Use the API (in another tab or in your browser)**

```
